# Welcome to Amr Yasser's Cybersecurity Hub!

__I’m Amr Yasser, a Junior Penetration Tester with a keen interest in cybersecurity and a solid foundation in ethical hacking. My journey began with a fascination for uncovering vulnerabilities and has since evolved into a passion for safeguarding digital landscapes.__

# Who Am I?

As a Junior Penetration Tester, I specialize in identifying and addressing security flaws in systems and applications. My approach combines hands-on experience with a deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, thanks to my extensive study of key certifications.

# What I Do

* __Penetration Testing:__ I perform in-depth assessments to find and exploit security weaknesses, helping organizations enhance their defenses.

* __CTF (Capture The Flag) Competitions:__ Participating in CTF challenges sharpens my skills and keeps me updated with the latest in cybersecurity.

* __Hack The Box:__ I tackle challenging machines on Hack The Box to stay on the cutting edge of penetration testing techniques.

# Education and Skills

Although I haven’t formally earned certifications, I’ve rigorously studied the following:

```eJPTv2``` (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester v2): This study provided me with a strong foundation in penetration testing methodologies.

```eWPTv2``` (eLearnSecurity Web Application Penetration Tester v2): My in-depth study of this material enhanced my skills in identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities.

```OSCP``` (Offensive Security Certified Professional): My extensive review of OSCP content has equipped me with advanced techniques for comprehensive penetration testing.

# My Approach

__My methodology involves a thorough, detail-oriented approach to penetration testing. I focus on not just identifying vulnerabilities but also understanding their implications and providing actionable recommendations.__

# Connect with Me

__I’m always open to discussions about cybersecurity, penetration testing, or the latest industry trends. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or learn more about how I can help secure your digital assets.__
